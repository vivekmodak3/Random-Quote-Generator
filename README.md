 You can Add more properties to the quote object. 
 For example, a tags property could include a list of "tags" like -- "humor", "business", "politics" -- to categorize each quote.
 Randomly change the background color of the page, when the quote changes.
 Don't display a random quote more than once until ALL quotes from the array have been displayed.
 Refresh the quote after a set amount of time. 
 For example, every 30 seconds, make a new quoteappear. 
 (You can use the setInterval() or setTimeout() method to do this)
